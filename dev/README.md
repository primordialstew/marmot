Files in this directory are for development and learning purposes only. They
are here so that they are out of the main app, for easy cleanup/removal in the
future. They are not ignored so that I can share them across machines via
GitHub until I am done with them (as opposed to my ``tmp`` directory which is
listed in my ``excludes`` file).
